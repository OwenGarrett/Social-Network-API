# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission for Module 18. I appreciate your feedback and I will make any neccessary changes based off of your grading. 

This Socxial Network API may be initialized in VS Code by using the terminal command "npm start" and utilizes Mongoose, Express.js and the MongoDB database.

Once you have initialized the express, you may make API POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in Insomnia to create, update, and delete users as well as thoughts or comments in the database. When the API POST and DELETE routes are ran in Insomnia, the user will be able to create and remove reactions to their thoughts as well as add/remove friends from the users' friend list. You will also be able to API GET for users and thoughts.
